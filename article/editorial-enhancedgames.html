      The Enhanced Games promise fame and fortune, but at the cost of health and integrity.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a recent outreach on social media, the Enhanced Games announced their venue to be in Las Vegas in the spring of 2026. In the past months, this corporation has signed with many high‑profile athletes such as the English swimmer Benjamin Proud. However, the organization causes much debate regarding unnecessary health risks. Indeed, this sports organization hosts competitions without any drug tests, encouraging the use of performance‑enhancing drugs (PEDs).

    <p>
      A question is raised from this: why do world‑class swimmers accept to take PEDs although their bodies are supposed to be temples? The answer, while being controversial, is money. Swimming does not have the same media attention as football (soccer or American football), which means athletes are not paid enough for the work they put in. Training twice a day every day for years to only win $25,000 for first place is cruel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Enhanced Games offer $1,000,000 to anyone who can break a world record. In my opinion, this will force World Aquatics to change how they publicize their competitions and events in order to pay athletes what they are truly due.
