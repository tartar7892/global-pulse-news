    <p>
      In the Philippines there are massive protests against the government for corruption and incompetence. These protests started in early September 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
      In September, the citizens of Philippines started to notice that a lot of public project like bridges or draining system and barricade were made poorly or they were incomplete. From there people from different groups students, civil right groups and even the religion started to protest against the government. They want to know where the money is going and stop the corruption.
    </p>

    <p>
      The government should publicise the source of funds because in the situation of the Philippines where there is flood, typhoon, and overall bad weather, draining system and barricade are necessary for the population who lived there. The corruption is putting people in danger and they need to act now.
