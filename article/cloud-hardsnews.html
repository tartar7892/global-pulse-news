      A massive Cloudflare outage caused millions of websites to go down for four hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yesterday, a massive Cloudflare outage occurred, which caused many websites to be inaccessible for approximately four hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      This breakdown started at 11 am when suddenly millions of websites including X (Twitter), Facebook, Discord and many more went down. Even DownDetector, the site used to see if websites are down, was not accessible!
    </p>

    <p>
      It was caused by one thing: Cloudflare. This American service is used by many websites to optimize their traffic and protect them from DDOS attacks. A small issue at Cloudflare caused all websites using it to be completely inaccessible. And there were many. It is estimated that 20% of all websites on the internet use Cloudflare.
    </p>

    <p>
      And for some London citizens, it was even worse; WARP, a service that provided better internet, was temporarily disabled in London, which caused all people using it to simply not have internet at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, after a mass panic, Cloudflare patched the issue and websites slowly came back after 2 pm. This was great news for many people, particularly for those who relied on a website which was down to work.
    </p>

    <p>
      This outage occurred just a few weeks after an Amazon AWS breakdown, which also caused many websites to be down for a few hours. This shows that many things on the internet depend on the same giant services, and so some people used these events to criticize this dependency.
