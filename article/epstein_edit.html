      Despite bipartisan pressure, the Epstein files remain hidden, fueling suspicion and political tension.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Epstein files are still unknown, even though a motion to force a release was voted more than a week ago. 
      To end the shutdown, Republicans had to accept this law. However, right‑wing senators seem less and less reliable 
      since they continue to hide the truth despite the efforts of Democrats.
    </p>

    <p>
      Relevant information about Donald Trump is kept secret. The link between Trump and Epstein is already established 
      and doesn’t need to be proved anymore. If there was nothing in the files about the main suspect in this affair, 
      why should he keep the public in doubt?
    </p>

    <p>
      Trump has already placed himself as a king. In theory, only close people to him know the content of the file. 
      But in fact, it feels like all senators know the key information, defending it so well. Even if they ignore 
      everything about it, they follow their leader blindly.
