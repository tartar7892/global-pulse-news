      An opinion on how current uses of AI risk damaging creativity and human work.
    </p>

    <p>
      AI can be useful sometimes, but how people currently use it is very dangerous for creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, a lot of AI is used for image generation and it’s not a good thing, because I really think AI cannot reproduce human emotion and all the other aspects that make human art. This is exactly the same for AI music; it simply doesn't have human taste.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also need to talk about the fact that AI is used to replace a job that was done previously by a human. It’s sad because AI is not as good as a human, and it’s terrible for people. Maybe AI can be good for mechanical and repetitive jobs. It will be a good thing if AI replaces that type of job so humans can do more interesting and creative ones, but it seems that the exact opposite is happening right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      So we really need to change our use of AI, because it will destroy creativity while in fact it could help us do better things.
