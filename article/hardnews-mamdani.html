      Zohran Mamdani becomes New York’s first Democrat mayor, announcing major reforms and drawing strong reactions.

    <p>
      Zohran Mamdani has become the first Democrat mayor of New York, announcing several major policy proposals for the city. His plans include providing free public transport tickets for all citizens, increasing wages for low-income residents, expanding social housing, and introducing new taxes for individuals with over $1 million in capital. He also intends to raise taxes on large companies to finance these measures.

      The election has sparked strong reactions. Eric Trump stated that the new mayor “is antisemitic,” while other critics describe him as a radical Democrat who worries the wealthiest residents. Mamdani, who lived in Queens and commuted by subway before the election, has a net worth of around $150,000. His new salary of $250,000 per month has generated debate within the Republican Party.

      During his campaign, Mamdani relied heavily on social media and gained significant support from younger voters. He is expected to take office on January 1st, 2026, facing both high expectations and strong scrutiny.
