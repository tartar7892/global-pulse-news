      Zohran Mamdani’s election as New York’s first Democrat mayor sparks both hope and controversy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Zohran Mamdani became the first Democrat Mayor of New York, a decision that sparked controversy among Republicans, who consider him a radical democrat. In my opinion, this is good news, because the city needs a major change. Mamdani comes from a “normal” background: he is not rich, he lives in a small apartment in Queens, and he stays close to the younger population of New York. He also uses social media actively for his campaign.

    <p>
      For the first time during Trump’s mandate, Mamdani has managed to create a strong political opposition against him. He has many great ideas, but if he cannot apply them, it could become a disaster, because many people see hope in him. For now, he continues to perform well in the statistics, so we will see what happens on January 1st, 2026.
