      The Senate forces the release of the Epstein files, triggering strong political and public reactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Epstein files were released today following a Senate vote compelling their publication. In recent days, Republican lawmakers had increased pressure on the government to make the documents public, echoing demands from protesters in the “No Kings in America” movement.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reactions were mixed in the hours after the release. Some argued that transparency was necessary given the scale of Epstein’s alleged activities, while others warned that releasing large amounts of unverified information could unfairly affect individuals indirectly connected to the case.
    </p>

    <p>
      The documents contain written accounts of gatherings linked to Epstein, including references to Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. However, the files include few names and no photos or videos. Many details remain unconfirmed, and several elements appear incomplete or based on assumptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The release is expected to have significant political repercussions as investigators and the public continue to examine the material in the coming days.
