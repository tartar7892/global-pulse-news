      A catastrophic fire burned for over 43 hours, killing 161 people and devastating the Tai Po community.

      In what has been described as the city's most catastrophic fire in nearly 80 years, the Wang Fuk Court fire in November 2025 has left an strong mark on the community of Tai Po. The blaze, which ignited on the afternoon of November 26, burned the buildings for over 43 hours, ultimately claiming the lives of 161 people, including one firefighter.

      The fire rapidly escalated into a level 5 alarm event, the highest possible rating, as flames spread across seven of the complex’s eight residential towers. Investigators believe the fire was fueled by a deadly combination of bamboo scaffolding and non-flame-resistant safety netting that acted as a fuse, carrying the fire vertically across the 32-story buildings.

      Survivors reported a devastating scene, with many claiming that fire alarms failed to sound, forcing neighbors to bang on doors to alert one another.

      In the aftermath, the government has launched a criminal investigation, leading to at least 16 arrests related to the use of unsafe building materials. Chief Executive John Lee has promised comprehensive redevelopment and rehousing for the thousands displaced. However, the disaster has also drawn international scrutiny, with the UN expressing concern over the use of security laws to silence activists calling for greater government accountability.
