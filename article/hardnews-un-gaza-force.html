      The UN Security Council votes to deploy an international stabilization force in Gaza.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the 17th of November, the United Nations Security approved a resolution to send a force to Gaza.
      Indeed the United Nations Security Council has approved a US-backed resolution to deploy an international stabilization force in Gaza. The force will act to secure the areas, protect civilians and help to demilitarize Gaza which has been in conflict for a long time with Israel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plan also creates a temporary governance body in Gaza, which will oversee the administration until reforms to the Palestinians are completed. The resolution mentions a possible path toward a future Palestine State, though it sets conditions for political and security reforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the meeting of all the UNSC members, the vote passed with thirteen members in favour and two against the resolution: Russia and China. Many Arab and Muslim countries expressed their willingness to participate in the force.
    </p>

    <p>
      This decision raises many reactions: The US and several regional governments support the force; while the Hamad leadership rejects it, saying that Palestine would be under international control. Russia and China have strengthened their position, saying that the force would be too powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The differents reactions show us the chasm between two sides, which was present during the Cold War.
