      Travellers’ luggage was swept overboard in Thailand after rough seas hit a speedboat.
    </p>

    <p>
      Travellers suitcases washed overboard into the Sea in Thailand. Rough sea and choppy water caused the front to dip under a large wave, and because the bags had been left unsecured, dozens of them were swept off the boat. In my opinion, the incident shows a real problem of safety and organisation. The Indian Ocean is known for being rough and hostile, the Company should have more restrictions for security.

      Passengers captured the shocking moment in viral Tiktok videos, describing how their suitcases drifted away while they were trying to save them helplessly. I think that the company will be damaged by all the videos shared on social media.

      Although the crew managed to recover some of the bags immediately, and the speedboat later retrieved a few more, many remain missing. A passenger named Alice tried to negotiate for a large refund. After a long discussion, she finally accepted 2,000 dollars. In my opinion, the travellers should receive more, indeed their bags contained important objects for them.

      To conclude, this incident damages the truth between clients and the company. Travellers trust companies with their belongings, such negligence breaks this trust.
