      A clandestine mine collapsed in Venezuela after severe flooding, leaving several miners dead.

      In Venezuela, a tragic mining accident happened when a mine collapsed because of flooding. The mining sector was officially closed by the government because it was considered too dangerous, especially during the rainy season. However, many clandestine miners still came to work in the mine because of poverty and the lack of other job opportunities.

      Due to heavy rain, the mine was flooded and the ground became unstable. As a result, the mine collapsed and many miners were trapped underground. Several miners died during the accident. This tragedy shows the consequences of illegal mining and the lack of safety measures. It also highlights the responsibility of the government to better control dangerous areas and protect the population.
