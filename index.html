          <h3>Who we are</h3>
          <p>
            Global Pulse News is a student-created general news outlet developed as part of an English media course. We combine hard news, opinion pieces, and video content to explore how media shape our view of the world.

        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Our audience</h3>
          <p>
            Our primary audience is university students and young adults who want clear, accessible news in English, with enough context to understand complex stories without needing expert knowledge.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Our slant</h3>
          <p>
            We aim for neutral, fact-based reporting in our hard news articles. However, our editorials openly reflect a [centre / centre-left / centre-right / other] perspective on politics and society, encouraging debate and critical thinking.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>The gap we fill</h3>
          <p>
            While many young people get their information mainly from TikTok, Instagram, and quick headlines, Global Pulse News offers slower, more contextual journalism in English, with sources, explanations, and original analysis.
